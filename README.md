Visualise Data Through Scatter Plots
====================================

This [MLHub](https://mlhub.ai) package provides a simple demonstration
"model" showing the concept of scatter plots using the traditional Iris
dataset.

The examples come from the book, Essentials of Data Science, by Graham
Williams <https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science>. Further support
material is also available from <https://essentials.togaware.com/>.

Advanced forms of scatter plot are demonstrated in the include
[beeswarm](https://github.com/mlhubber/mlmodels/tree/master/beeswarm)
model package.

Usage
-----

To install and run the pre-built model:

    $ pip install mlhub
    $ ml install scatter
    $ ml configure scatter
    $ ml demo scatter
